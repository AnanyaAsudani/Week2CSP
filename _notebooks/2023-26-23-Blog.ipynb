    "## Tri One Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflecting on the first third of the AP CSP (Computer Science Principles) course, I've gained a fundamental understanding of the principles of computing and the role it plays in modern society. The initial modules introduced me to the basics of computational thinking, algorithms, and the broader impact of technology on various aspects of our lives. Understanding the importance of data and its ethical implications has been a crucial part of my learning experience so far. Additionally, the exploration of internet technologies and the significance of cybersecurity has broadened my perspective on the digital world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the finance-based projects, they have provided me with valuable insights into the practical applications of computing in the financial sector. Through these projects, I have honed my skills in using programming languages to analyze financial data, assess risks, and make informed decisions. These experiences have underscored the significance of data integrity, security, and privacy in financial transactions, emphasizing the need for robust computational solutions to ensure the smooth functioning of financial systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the combination of theoretical concepts in computer science and their practical applications in finance has deepened my understanding of both fields and highlighted their interdependence in the modern digital landscape. I look forward to further exploring the intricacies of these domains and applying my knowledge to real-world scenarios in the later stages of the AP CSP course.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I enjoyed-\n",
    "My favorite part of the first trimester of the course was the freedom with had with design. This allowed me to work at my fullest extent as it allowed me to present something I felt was important or that interested me. This is what helped me in my blog and I enjoyed the freedom given when creating the group passion project which allowed us to do finance, a topic everyone in our group was equally excited about.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I could do better next tri-\n",
    "I would enjoy focusing more on using javascript, python and other coding languages that conform witht the AP curriculum as well as practicing theory with pseudo code ratherr than working in HTML, and CSS. I also plan to read about these languages in my free time to expand my personal knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflecting on the initial phase of my AP CSP experience:\n",
    "\n",
    "During the first few weeks (0-3), I dedicated significant effort to acquainting myself with essential applications like Vscode and Github. Overcoming the learning curve was a bit challenging, but I managed to grasp the basics. Leveraging my prior Python knowledge, I embarked on several projects, one of which involved developing a functional weather program capable of retrieving temperature data based on user input. This project facilitated a solid understanding of JavaScript's frontend capabilities and the integration of external APIs. Additionally, I delved into constructing a spam email classifier, providing an insightful introduction to the realm of AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the subsequent weeks (4-7), my exploration of web programming deepened, focusing on mastering JavaScript syntax, particularly variable usage and looping mechanisms. I also became well-acquainted with the utility of GitHub Utterance comments, recognizing their value in receiving constructive feedback and fostering user engagement. Furthermore, I familiarized myself with fundamental aspects of project management, including team roles and agile methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter phase (weeks 8-12) marked an exciting transition as I enthusiastically contributed to a team project centered around Cryptography. My responsibilities as a backend engineer involved developing AI decryption models. Additionally, I enhanced the project's frontend by incorporating dynamic elements, such as visual effects, and working on the backend through importing different graph versions which were then formatted and displayed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this initial segment of the AP CSP journey has been a rich learning experience, enhancing my proficiency in JavaScript, Python machine learning, and markup languages like HTML. I look forward to leveraging these skills in the forthcoming trimesters to tackle more complex challenges and expand my expertise in the dynamic field of computer science."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This is Important\n",
    "Certainly! The imports in the provided code are important for various functionalities required in the application that displays stock graphs and provides stock recommendations. Here's an explanation of each import:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Flask**: Flask is a popular web framework in Python that is used to build web applications. It is essential for creating the web application and defining the routes for displaying stock data and recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Blueprint, jsonify, request**: These are necessary for creating modular and reusable components within the Flask application. They help in defining specific routes and handling HTTP requests and responses, which are crucial for fetching and displaying stock data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **pandas**: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library in Python. It is used for data analysis and manipulation, making it essential for handling and processing stock data before displaying it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **yfinance**: This library allows access to Yahoo Finance's API, enabling the retrieval of stock market data. It is crucial for fetching stock data and using it to display graphs and make recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **plotly.graph_objs**: Plotly is a visualization library that provides interactive and high-quality graphs. With `graph_objs`, the code can create visually appealing and informative stock graphs for better visualization of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **datetime**: This library is important for handling date and time-related operations. It is necessary for specifying the date range when fetching historical stock data and for various other time-related calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Flask-Restful**: Flask-Restful is an extension for Flask that simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs. It makes it easier to define resources and their corresponding HTTP methods, which are crucial for creating endpoints for the stock data and recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **numpy**: NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, which might be useful for various calculations and data manipulation tasks when dealing with stock data.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **flask_cors**: Flask-CORS is a Flask extension for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), which is crucial for allowing the application to make requests to a different domain. This is important when the application needs to fetch data from an external source, such as a stock market API.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **TensorFlow and Keras**: These libraries are essential for creating and training machine learning models. In this case, they are used to train a neural network model for predicting stock prices. TensorFlow is a powerful open-source machine learning framework, and Keras is an API that serves as an interface for TensorFlow, making it easier to build and train deep learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "These imports collectively provide the necessary tools and functionality to create a web application that can display stock graphs and provide recommendations based on historical and latest stock data.\n"

About Me? Page Description
In this page I have an explanation of myself showing the viewer all they need to know about me. It has my class schedule and hobbies as well. 


Problems:
I had some trouble inserting images into my homepage


Solution:
We were able to use a website and a different type of file allowing us to upload  images.


Skills used/learned:
I learned the HTML language and was able to practice and learn hwo to insert and add things. This led me to add simple games and things to make my webpage more fun and interactive.

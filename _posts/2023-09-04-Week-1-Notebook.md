What We Did:
We were able to insert the snake game onto our website. This was the code uploaded on slack and we added it onto our blog along with unity game.
Problems:
Some issues we had were with the display. The theme wouldn't support snake and would show text covering it. We had a spacing issue and so when we added more space between snake and the other codes and changed the theme allowing it to work better.
What We Learned
We learned how to adapt when themes wouldnt work and were able to understand the formatting in github themes

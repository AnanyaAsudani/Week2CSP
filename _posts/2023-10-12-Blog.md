## Note:
This was a code I made in the early parts of the project in markdown to show a potential topic for our finance project. Though in the early works I believe that this helped us understand our code would be better off if we implemented stocks rather than banking and loan calculators as this can often be achieved from any other website. 


```python
from flask import Blueprint, jsonify, request
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime
from flask_restful import Api, Resource
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier


def train_stock_prediction_model(stock_name):
    end_date = datetime.now()
    start_date = end_date - pd.Timedelta(days=4856)

    df = yf.download(stock_name, start=start_date, end=end_date)

    # preprocess the data
    df['Close'] = df['Close'].pct_change()  # calculate daily returns
    df = df.dropna()

    X = df[['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close']].values
    y = (df['Close'] > 0).astype(int)  # 1 if price increase 0 if decreased

    # split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # create and train a DecisionTreeClassifier
    model = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    return model

# modify the get_stock_recommendation function


def get_stock_recommendation(stock_name, model):
    end_date = datetime.now()
    start_date = end_date - pd.Timedelta(days=1)

    df = yf.download(stock_name, start=start_date, end=end_date)

    if df.empty:
        return {'error': 'No data found for the provided stock ticker.'}, 404

    df['Close'] = df['Close'].pct_change().iloc[-1]

    X = df[['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close']].values
    # reshape the input for prediction
    prediction = model.predict(X.reshape(1, -1))

    if prediction == 1:
        recommendation = 'Buy'
        reason = f'The model predicts a price increase based on historical data. The value of prediction is {prediction[0]}. This means there will most likely be an increase in price overall'
    else:
        recommendation = 'Sell/Don\'t Buy'
        reason = f'The model predicts a price decrease based on historical data. The value of prediction is {prediction[0]}. This means there will most likely be a decrease in price overall'

    return {'recommendation': recommendation, 'reason': reason}


class _AnalyzeStock(Resource):
    def get(self, stock_name):
        try:
            model = train_stock_prediction_model(stock_name)
            recommendation = get_stock_recommendation(stock_name, model)
            return jsonify(recommendation)
        except Exception as e:
            return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500



```


```python
// Function to calculate compound interest
function calculateCompoundInterest(principal, rate, time) {
    // Convert rate to decimal
    rate = rate / 100;
  
    // Calculate compound interest
    let compoundInterest = principal * Math.pow(1 + rate, time) - principal;
  
    return compoundInterest;
}

// Example usage
let principal = 1000; // Example principal amount
let rate = 5; // Example annual interest rate
let time = 3; // Example time period in years

// Call the function and store the result in a variable
let result = calculateCompoundInterest(principal, rate, time);

// Output the result to the console
console.log("The compound interest is: " + result);


```

# Note:
This is another example of how I attempted to show a possible idea for our code, a little more developed as it is in Javascript rather than HTML allowing it to be transported to our actual site and though it was used for reference, did not make it in the final project. 


Final tweaks and changes to the code:

Main goal 1- Make frontend more appealing to the user. 

Plans:
Set the layout to be well done and add buttons. 
Keep a consise theme throughout the webpage and organize it
Theme should be simple yet tech-y as beginners in tech and finance are our main audience

Main goal 2-reahearse presentation
learn other people's pieces of the project. (easy task for us as we worked through majority of the code as a group)
Delegate who is going to say what, and have one main speaker to present the page.

## Tri One Reflection

Reflecting on the first third of the AP CSP (Computer Science Principles) course, I've gained a fundamental understanding of the principles of computing and the role it plays in modern society. The initial modules introduced me to the basics of computational thinking, algorithms, and the broader impact of technology on various aspects of our lives. Understanding the importance of data and its ethical implications has been a crucial part of my learning experience so far. Additionally, the exploration of internet technologies and the significance of cybersecurity has broadened my perspective on the digital world.

In terms of the finance-based projects, they have provided me with valuable insights into the practical applications of computing in the financial sector. Through these projects, I have honed my skills in using programming languages to analyze financial data, assess risks, and make informed decisions. These experiences have underscored the significance of data integrity, security, and privacy in financial transactions, emphasizing the need for robust computational solutions to ensure the smooth functioning of financial systems.

Overall, the combination of theoretical concepts in computer science and their practical applications in finance has deepened my understanding of both fields and highlighted their interdependence in the modern digital landscape. I look forward to further exploring the intricacies of these domains and applying my knowledge to real-world scenarios in the later stages of the AP CSP course.

What I enjoyed-
My favorite part of the first trimester of the course was the freedom with had with design. This allowed me to work at my fullest extent as it allowed me to present something I felt was important or that interested me. This is what helped me in my blog and I enjoyed the freedom given when creating the group passion project which allowed us to do finance, a topic everyone in our group was equally excited about.

What I could do better next tri-
I would enjoy focusing more on using javascript, python and other coding languages that conform witht the AP curriculum as well as practicing theory with pseudo code ratherr than working in HTML, and CSS. I also plan to read about these languages in my free time to expand my personal knowledge.


Reflecting on the initial phase of my AP CSP experience:

During the first few weeks (0-3), I dedicated significant effort to acquainting myself with essential applications like Vscode and Github. Overcoming the learning curve was a bit challenging, but I managed to grasp the basics. Leveraging my prior Python knowledge, I embarked on several projects, one of which involved developing a functional weather program capable of retrieving temperature data based on user input. This project facilitated a solid understanding of JavaScript's frontend capabilities and the integration of external APIs. Additionally, I delved into constructing a spam email classifier, providing an insightful introduction to the realm of AI.

In the subsequent weeks (4-7), my exploration of web programming deepened, focusing on mastering JavaScript syntax, particularly variable usage and looping mechanisms. I also became well-acquainted with the utility of GitHub Utterance comments, recognizing their value in receiving constructive feedback and fostering user engagement. Furthermore, I familiarized myself with fundamental aspects of project management, including team roles and agile methodologies.

The latter phase (weeks 8-12) marked an exciting transition as I enthusiastically contributed to a team project centered around Cryptography. My responsibilities as a backend engineer involved developing AI decryption models. Additionally, I enhanced the project's frontend by incorporating dynamic elements, such as visual effects, and working on the backend through importing different graph versions which were then formatted and displayed. 

Overall, this initial segment of the AP CSP journey has been a rich learning experience, enhancing my proficiency in JavaScript, Python machine learning, and markup languages like HTML. I look forward to leveraging these skills in the forthcoming trimesters to tackle more complex challenges and expand my expertise in the dynamic field of computer science.

    For each element in the list:
        If the current element is greater than the next element:
            Swap the elements
            Set the flag to False
```

### Example 2: Pseudo Code for a basic iterative function

## Challenges we as a team faced
#1: My commits stopped working for a period of time and until we fixed the issue I was unable to commit anything. While we were focusing on fixing this, our temporary solution was to call to complete code and/or I would send my coded parts to someone else so they could commit the code, allowing it to show up.

#2: Unclear idea of the project. Though we all knew the project was about finance we all had different views of what it would do. For example at the beginning we were divided n whether it should have been an organizer for taxes for a person ort a stocks app. We finally sat down and discussed our fial goal and decided on focusing on stocks and how a beginner could learn about them

#3: Connecting frontend and backend. I believe this was an issue for majority of teams but we had trouble connecting our frontend and backend as well as working to fix up our frontend in a way that works accordingly to the backend. This allowed for all team members to have a deeper understanding of parts of the code they didn't do

Overall, communication was the thing that fixed our various problems and we were able to work as a team and understand our project as a group to prevent issues.

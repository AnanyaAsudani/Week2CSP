What we did:
This week we worked on adding more games such as a factorial calculator, timer, essay orgaizer etc. zthis week we added a timer, essay organizer, book MLA format creator, factorial calculator, puzzle game, and a basic database. For these games I worled on adding themes and colors as well as using similar codes for the MLA format maker and essay organizer to show how we can creatively use coding templates.

Issues:
Some issues we had were with the python quiz. This ties to the Jupyter notebook issue as when we add a notebook in Python the site crashes or  doesnt work, showing an error message. This is due to an iniability to open jupyter notebook in week 2 CSP as we are only able to open it thorugh Anaconda.

Another issue we had was with the timer as the spacing of the numbers and line was hard to pinpoint with the theme. 

Lastly, the basic database was an issue it did not support indented paragraphs in the code and was incredibly difficult to make complex without paragraphs or time to code several different parts to the database.

Solution: The Anaconda issue is still in prograss but for the timer we were able to center the watch hand and numbers through trial and error. The Python quiz we inserted as a HTML file so we could still display our knowledge of python on this laptop.

In the futurw for the database I plan to keep adding to it slowly over time making it more complex. Another thing I added were link's to resources that a prson could go to to learn more about the specific slected topic.

Skills learned: through this we were able to learn several diffent methods of using HTML and were able to better understand how to create code using this language.

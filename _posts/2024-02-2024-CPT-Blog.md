46% of Americans experience diagnosable mental health conditions at some point in their life. Mental Health affects a large percent of the population and those who do not have diagnosable issues are not exempt from having to make time to take care of their mental health. This website not only gives a preliminary diagnosis but also provides a platform for users to give updates on their life and mental capacity, vent to AI and get helpful feedback from the comfort of their own homes, but also provides games to help increase attention span, calm mood, and more!

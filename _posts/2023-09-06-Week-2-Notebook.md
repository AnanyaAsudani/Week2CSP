What We Did
In this week we worked on coding tic tac toe and practicing HTML

Issues: 
Though we didn't have any issues with this portion of the week we started having issues regarding installing jupyter notebook. This wouldn't open in our terminal and would show a blank screen rather than the repository.
 
Solution: We tried updating my laptop to the latest version and were able. We were able to redownload anaconda and when opening Jupyter notebook through that it opened.

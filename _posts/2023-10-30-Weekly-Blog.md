Final tweaks and changes to the code:

Main goal 1- Make frontend mre appealing to the user. 

Plans:
Set the layout to be well done and add buttons. 
Keep a consise theme throughout the webpage and organize it
Theme should be simple yet tech-y as beginners in tech and finance are our main audience

Main goal 2-reahearse presentation
learn other people's pieces of the project. (easy task for us as we worked through majority of the code as a group)
Delegate who is going to say what, and have one main speaker to present the page.
